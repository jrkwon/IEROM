## Internet-Enabled RObotic Microscope

This project is about developing a new high-throughput and high-resolution three dimensional tissue scanner with an Internetconnected
3D virtual microscope for large scale automated histology. This instrument is based on a 3D tissue imaging method called Knife Edge Scanning Microscopy (KESM). A prototype instrument was designed and built based on this technology to scan various tissue samples using mouse brain and octopus brain. The new system of our design improves on the first prototype in multiple design aspects and reduces the instrument footprint and cost. We have also improved the controller software to be scalable for multiple instruments and to have a web-based interface. This new instrument allows verified users to access the microscope from anywhere on the globe using an application authentication framework.
